# Guided Attention Generative Network for Quality Enhancement of Compressed Video

### Requirements and dependencies
- [Pytorch 0.4.0](https://pytorch.org/)
- [TensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX)
- [FlowNet2-Pytorch](https://github.com/mengab/flownet2-pytorch)
- [PWC-Net](https://github.com/mengab/PWC-Net) (Code and model are already included in this repository)

The code was developed using Python 3.6 & PyTorch 0.4 & CUDA 8.0 on Ubuntu 16.04. There may be a problem related to software versions. To fix the problem, you may look at the implementation in GAGNet files and replace the syntax to match the new PyTorch environment.

### Installation
Download repository:

    git clone https://github.com/mengab/GAGNet.git

Compile BiFlowNet dependencies (Channelnorm layers, Correlation and Resample2d):

    ./install.sh
